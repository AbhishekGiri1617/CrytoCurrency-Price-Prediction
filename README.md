# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction   

## Overview  

This project uses machine learning to predict cryptocurrency prices.  It leverages historical price data and potentially other factors to forecast future values.

## Key Features  

-   Data loading and preprocessing of cryptocurrency price data.  
-   Implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM model for price prediction.  
-   Visualization of predicted vs. actual prices.  
-   Evaluation of model performance.  

## Technologies  

-   Python  
-   Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`.
